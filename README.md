Thank you for visiting my this repo. This is my class project for CMPE172 at SJSU. The website is up and running, however, I have delete the dabase due to cost. Sorry for your inconvenience. Feel free to experience the CRUD functionalities of this app. I deployed to AWS Amplify in 10/2019. You can also check out the Youtube url to see demo and my explanation of the architecture and build process.

For dev: 
HTML/CSS, React.js for the front-end. 
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB. 
AWS Cognito for authentication.
I hosted my website on AWS Amplify. It's a great service allowing CI/CD connecting with you Github repo.
